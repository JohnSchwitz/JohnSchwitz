I spent several months in 2021 reviewing my "first love" General Relativity. My video presentation is viewable in the Presentation Repository. This work boosted my Data Science when I investigated the software for detecting gravitational waves. It uses Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning which is a leap above of the current financial work on Volatility. Volatility forecasting with GARCH, Spectral, and Neural Network Models. I developed a Data Science On-line curriculum for ‘technically savvy’ veterans

Principal Data Scientist leading a team developing Transformer Models and Transfer Learning for Municipal Bonds, Mortgage Processing, and Limited Partnership Agreements.
