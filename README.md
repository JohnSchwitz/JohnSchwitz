I spent several months in 2021 reviewing my "first love" General Relativity. My video presentation is viewable in the Gravitational Wave Repository.

This investigation boosted my Machine Learning work on Volatility. Ge's 2022 ACM Systematic Review of Volatility Forecasting found a significant lag between "state of the art" ML and financial approaches for Volatility Forecasting. 

The software to filter gravitational waves from background noise is PyCBC. Its components {FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms for Spectral Analysis), Signal Processing, High Pass Filters, and Time and Frequency Domain Analysis} are advanced constituents for performing Volatility Analysis. I am deploying simplified code in a Repository. This code uses Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Convolution Neural Networks (EfficientNet v2) which is a leap above of the current financial work on Volatility. 

There are additional links to my Presentations and Data Science Course in the Repositories below.
