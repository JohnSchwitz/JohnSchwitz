<p>Hubble Space telescope image of the <strong>Crab Nebula</strong>, the remnants of <strong>SN 1054</strong> a supernova observed by <strong>Chinese astronomers</strong> in 1054.</p>

<p>I spent several months in 2021 reviewing my "first love" General Relativity. My video presentation is viewable in the Gravitational Wave Repository.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>This investigation boosted my Machine Learning work on Volatility. Ge's 2022 ACM Systematic Review of Volatility Forecasting found a significant lag between "state of the art" ML and financial approaches for Volatility Forecasting.</p>

<p>The software to filter gravitational waves from background noise is PyCBC. Its components {FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms for Spectral Analysis), Signal Processing, High Pass Filters, and Time and Frequency Domain Analysis} are advanced constituents for performing Volatility Analysis. I am deploying simplified code in a Repository. This code uses Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Convolution Neural Networks (EfficientNet v2) which is a leap above of the current financial work on Volatility.</p>

<p>There are additional links to my Presentations and Data Science Course in the Repositories below.</p>
